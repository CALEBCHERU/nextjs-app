> **NB**: Middleware is triggered on **any request to the server** **unless explicitly restricted** using the `matcher` configuration (as shown below).
>
> It runs on the **Edge runtime** (server-side), not in the browser.

---
In **Next.js**, a **middleware function** is a special piece of code that runs **before a request is completed**, allowing you to perform tasks like:

* Redirecting users
* Rewriting URLs
* Handling authentication and authorization
* Logging
* Modifying request/response headers

It runs **on the Edge**, meaning it executes on the server (closer to the user) and does **not** increase bundle size.

---

## üß± Basic Structure of Middleware in Next.js

You create a `middleware.ts` or `middleware.js` file at the **root of your project** (or inside specific folders for route-based middleware).

### ‚úÖ Example: Basic Middleware

```ts
// middleware.ts (at the root)

import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  console.log('Middleware running...')
  
  // Example: Redirect if not authenticated
  const isLoggedIn = request.cookies.get('auth-token')?.value
  if (!isLoggedIn && request.nextUrl.pathname !== '/login') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))
  }

  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration with `matcher`

You can control **which routes** the middleware applies to using the `config.matcher` export.

```ts
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/profile/:path*'], // Only apply middleware to these routes
}
```

---

## üîê Example: Auth Middleware

```ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const token = request.cookies.get('token')?.value

  if (!token && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/protected')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))
  }

  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'], // only for protected routes
}
```

---

## üìÇ Middleware in Subdirectories

You can also place a `middleware.ts` inside any route directory (like `/app/dashboard/middleware.ts` for app directory routing), and it will only apply to routes inside that folder.

---

## üß† Key Notes

* Middleware runs on the **Edge Runtime** (fast, low-latency).
* You cannot use regular Node.js APIs in middleware (like `fs`, `process`, etc.).
* It does **not** replace `getServerSideProps`, but complements it for request-level tasks.

Let me know if you want an example for a **login redirect**, **API rate limiting**, or **Geo-location routing** in middleware.

### üß≤ When and How is Middleware Triggered in Next.js?

Middleware in **Next.js** is automatically triggered by the **incoming HTTP request** to your app ‚Äî **before the actual route is rendered**.

---

## üìå **When is Middleware Called?**

Middleware is triggered:

1. **Before rendering a page** (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/profile`)
2. **Before API routes** (if you configure it that way)
3. On **client-side navigation** and **initial server-side request**
4. Whenever a route matching the `matcher` pattern is accessed

---

### ‚úÖ Example Timeline:

For a user going to `/dashboard`:

```text
1. User requests /dashboard
2. ‚û§ Middleware runs
   ‚îî Check cookies, tokens, etc.
3. If allowed ‚Üí Continue to /dashboard
4. If blocked ‚Üí Redirect to /login
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **How is it Triggered?**

1. You create `middleware.ts` (or `.js`) in the **project root** or route directory.
2. You export a function named `middleware` that accepts a `NextRequest` and returns `NextResponse`.
3. You define the `matcher` in `export const config` to specify which paths should trigger it.

```ts
// middleware.ts

import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  console.log('Running on:', request.nextUrl.pathname)
  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/profile/:path*'],
}
```

---

### üîÅ Triggered On:

* First page load from browser (server request)
* Internal navigation via `<Link />` or `router.push()` (client request)
* Refreshing the page
* Opening a URL directly
* Making a direct request to the route (like with `curl` or Postman)

---

## üß† Pro Tip

To test if middleware is being triggered, just add a `console.log()` or return a forced redirect:

```ts
console.log("Middleware triggered for:", request.nextUrl.pathname)
```

---

Let me know if you want help **logging**, **redirecting**, or **restricting access** based on routes!
========
You're close! Here's a corrected and clearer version of your statement:

---

Great question! ‚úÖ Yes, **middleware can be placed inside a subfolder** ‚Äî but only if you're using the **App Router** (`app/` directory introduced in Next.js 13+). Here's a full explanation:

---

## üìÅ Middleware Location Options

### 1. ‚úÖ **Root Middleware (Works for Both App and Pages Router)**

Place `middleware.ts` or `middleware.js` in the root of your project:

```
/middleware.ts
/pages
/app
```

This applies globally or to routes defined in the `matcher`.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **Middleware Inside Subfolders (Only in App Router)**

If you're using the **App Router**, you can place `middleware.ts` inside a specific folder (e.g. `/app/dashboard/`) to scope the middleware to that route:

```
/app/dashboard/middleware.ts
```

This middleware will automatically apply only to the `/dashboard` route and its children (e.g. `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/profile`, etc.).

> üß† No need to define a `matcher` in this case ‚Äî it's scoped based on the directory.

---

### 3. ‚ùå **Middleware in Subfolders with Pages Router**

If you're still using the **Pages Router** (`/pages/`), you **cannot** place middleware inside folders like `/pages/api/` or `/pages/dashboard/`.

> It must live at the root, and you must use `matcher` to control where it applies.

| Folder Structure           | Supported? | Notes                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/middleware.ts`           | ‚úÖ          | Global middleware                  |

| `/pages/.../middleware.ts` | ‚ùå          | Not supported                      |
